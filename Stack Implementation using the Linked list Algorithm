ii)Stack Implementation Using Linked List:

Algorithm for Push():
•	Initialise a node
•	Update the value of that node by data i.e. node->data = data
•	Now link this node to the top of the linked list
•	And update top pointer to the current node

Algorithm for Pop():
•	First Check whether there is any node present in the linked list or not, if not then return
•	Otherwise make pointer let say temp to the top node and move forward the top node by 1 step
•	Now free this temp node.

Algorithm for Peek():
•	Check if there is any node present or not, if not then return.
•	Otherwise return the value of top node of the linked list

Algorithm for display():
•	Take a temp node and initialize it with top pointer 
•	Now start traversing temp till it encounters NULL
•	Simultaneously print the value of the temp node
